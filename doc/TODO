implementing sort assuming all the inputs are right

* implement sort for default behavior   
    >> should take input of a filename and sort the content of it. 
    >> should take in multiple files and sort the content of it. 
    >> should take in the stdin and sort the content. 

* add -r option to sort 
    >> should reverse the sort. 
    >> make it reverse the whole sorted data in the last step before output. 
    
* add -f option to the sort
    >> should ignore the case of the input. 
    >> change the case of the data before you send it in for sorting.
